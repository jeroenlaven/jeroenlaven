Working at an art institution, being accessible to as many people as possible, is one of the most important points on the agenda. People need to feel welcome, the information should be accessible not only in printed form but also in for example audio recordings, so visually impaired visitors still have an option to enjoy the exhibitions and art.

Yesterday I was scrolling through my Twitter feed, and found this video of a girl, blind, using an iPhone to post a tweet and browse the internet. It's amazing how far technology has come, and how it can enrich lives in different ways. Especially the braille typing impressed me, and how fast is Kirsty...? :)
