For my work, I am constantly looking into new fonts. New ideas, approaches, and above all fresh looking letters that catch my eye. Just a few days ago [@erikspiekermann](https://twitter.com/espiekermann) (look that guy up!) tweeted about a new font-family by [newglyph](https://beta.newglyph.com/ "newglyph"):

> The quintessential classic fonts collection with a contemporary licensing system. Developing variable design systems and standard formats (otf, web) to fit our ever-changing global communication needs. We are a forward-thinking company committed to supporting social and ecological causes for the benefit of humanity and all life on earth.

4 amazing fonts, for an amazing price, and presented in such a way that you immediately get an idea on how these could look in your own design or text file. Below a short GIF on how your mouse moves the fonts in weight and width!
