Every morning I want to start with a short run. 5 km, half an hour â€” I love it. Still, I procrastinate, snoozing in the morning, waking up too late. A cold shower though is something I religiously start my morning with, every day of the week. It kick-starts your day, removes headaches, hangovers as well, and wakes me up like nothing else.
