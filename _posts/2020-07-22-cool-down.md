Summer means nice weather, most of the time. Here in Rotterdam it still feels like summer hasn't fully started yet. But when it gets hot, Sony has a new has a pretty cool new gadget for you. A wearable airconditioner. Specially made for the grueling hot summers in Japan.

> The Reon Pocket is a fairly slim palm-sized white plastic device that charges over USB-C and connects to your iOS or Android phone with Bluetooth. It definitely looks like a Sony gadget. There’s a silicone pad on the back that you can press against your skin, and the Reon Pocket uses the [Peltier effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect#Peltier_effect) to cool or warm itself up by absorbing and releasing heat. You can use it handheld, but the most widely promoted use cases involves buying Sony’s special V-neck undershirts with a pocket on the inner back to keep the device resting between your shoulder blades.
